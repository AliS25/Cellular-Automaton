# Cellular-Automaton
**Cellular-Automaton** is a web program that generates a collection of cells according to a set of states and rules. A cellular automaton is a universe of cells where the generation of cells is controlled by the initial state of the first row of cells and a set of eight rules representing all the possible states of the three parent cells from the previous generation. The user can set the desired universe size. The user can select a custom color for the cells that are alive. Moreover, the user can choose a rule number that would be displayed in the ruleset and applied to the universe of cells. Alternatively, the user can manually edit the rules that control the universe of cells. The userâ€™s custom set of rules displays the corresponding rule number. The program also allows users to add randomness to the cells generated. Lastly, the user can turn the first generation of cells on or off.
